# AutoPiano
A program that can play almost any song in piano simulators

# How to use
install Python (I used 3.10.4)

install the pynput library
```bash
pip install pynput
```

run the .exe file "AutoPiano.exe" or the script "AutoPiano.py"

enter the keys that will be pressed:
a - just a key
A - a key together with shift
[fA] - simultaneous pressing
| - skip (for pauses)

These keys can be found on the Internet, several sites will be presented below

Next, enter the delay between keystrokes, most often it is 0.2 seconds

After this, you have 5 seconds to prepare, after which the program will begin execution.
